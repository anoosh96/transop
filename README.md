Transparent Politics (maybe Katata, maybe something else entirely)

A platform for online community presence. A website designed to simplify the aspects of coordinating shared activities and achieve common goals.
When a group of people gathers to achieve a common goal, natural needs occur - such as definition of roles, responsibilities, initiatives, election of leaders, gathering and expression of opinion, decision making, information sharing, internal communications, analytics gathering and tracking. These processees are (if done at all) usually done ad-hoc, on a one off basis, word of mouth, or based on trust. 
We believe that in order to achieve long term communal success, these processees must be automated as much as possible, as well as made transparent for everyone involved - hence the name. We think this will promote collaboration, spark community initiatives, help old initiatives run more efficiently and transparently. We also believe that this may help certain communities attract external investment, increase their efficiency, build trust through process and transparency and outreach.
On the transparent politics website, a user can register an account, and then create or join a existing community. They can view the public pages of other public communities as well. Once a community is created, it gets its own public page, similar to how Shopify creates a store. Members of the community can interact with their public page in various ways, based on the roles that they have within the community. Admin of the community can define what features the community has by enabling modules. Some base modules are provided by us. Future modules can be custom coded, or can be selected from a previously custom coded and submitted selection in an "app-store" fashion. Some examples of modules are: News, Events, Blog, Polls, etc.

Use cases
- A group of individuals running an eco farm want to keep track of their work and streamline the daily process. (Sub plot ownership definition, membership responsibilities, agreements, expense tracking)
- Members of a high rise building want to create a coop to facilitate some activities in their building (child daycare, paint the lobby, plant some flowers, BBQ, swimming pool sundays)
- Large family or a group of friends are organizing a large event (or ritual) (holiday, a monthly meeting at the sauna, camping)
- Gated Community wants to track their initiatives and facilitate the community membership fee gathering, contract agreements and communication through a central hub. (Do we want to install cameras? Is the security good enough? Should we hire a bus to take out the kids to the park every saturday? Who forgot to pay for tree trimmings this month?)
- A group of volunteers decided to fundraise for a kids park, then track their expenses and report on activities.
- An internal platform for business employees to use for activities, contact info, fund gathering (birthday presents, parties), record keeping, stimulating good humanity - somewhat Shopify's Unicorn?
- Bike clubs, Yacht clubs, Rowing crews, Minor sports leagues, kids camps and camping grounds, large ecological initiatives (#teamtrees #teamseas etc), forest planting, volunteering initiatives.
- With the idea of "modules" being expandable, and user defined, eventually Transparent Politics becomes a platform for a community, and the specific needs and functions of each community can picked and chosen from an "app store" like experience. 
	Examples of potential modules:
	- someone writes a module for World of Warcraft API integration, so a guild can have a frontpage for their members. 
	- someone writes a Shopify module to add an online store intergarition to the community - so our members can integrate their Shopify stores, maybe creating one large store for the entire community (one produces hand knit socks, another produces straw hats, another produces birch tree syrop, they all have their individual stores, but also contribute to one shares store in the community) 
	- someone writes a module for Dungeons and Dragons rulesets
